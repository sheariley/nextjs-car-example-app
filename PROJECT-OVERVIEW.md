# Concept
* Build an app that displays a page that displays a table of cars.
* Cars have a make, model, year, and features.
* Cars should be filterable by make, model, year, and features.
* You should also be able to create, update, and delete cars.
* Each car should have its own show page, accessible from the list.

# Constraints and Expectations:
* You have the freedom to choose whatever frameworks, libraries, or packages you like, but the front end should use React.
* You can provide either a GitHub or Bitbucket repository link, or a zip file of your app's contents.
* Authentication is not required.
